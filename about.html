    <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Harsh Kuniya</strong> — a Computer Science undergraduate and proud member
        of the General College Forum (GCF). I believe in using my position to create a positive
        and inclusive environment on campus for all students.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        Beyond academics, I am passionate about community building, organizing college events,
        and helping fellow students navigate college life. I am also interested in software
        development and always looking to grow my technical and leadership skills.
    </p>
